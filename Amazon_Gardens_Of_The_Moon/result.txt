****This is a dark, grown up fantasy series.  Don't expect the typical story lines, and plot progression. I think a lot of people who call this &#34;difficult&#34; fantasy, however, are over-stating the reality.  This isn't &#34;difficult&#34; it just isn't obedient to the typical formulas fantasy readers have come to expect.

Many have spoken about the fact that you don't know what is going on and have to &#34;figure it out&#34; as you go.  Sanderson fans will hate that - sorry - not meant to be an insult, but that is indicative of Sanderson's style.  His magic system is very direct and easy to understand.  This series is not.  This book doesn't answer all your questions, either.

So, to be more precise, &#34;difficult&#34; is just too vague.  I would say this story develops suspense and makes you wonder about the politics, the motivations of the characters and the way the magic and world works without digressing to explain anything to you or to resolve all your questions. You must stick with the story to find out everything.  There are no 'informative digressions', which is a common feature in fantasy today.  What I mean by 'informative digression' is a point in the text where the main character or narrator will, as an aside, stop and 'catch you up' on how the world works, what his/her motivations are and just spend a page or so explaining things about the world and how things work in the world to you.

So, this series has NO 'informative digressions'.

Also, most modern fantasy is much more character focused.  These are all stylistic choices, not substantive choices.  It may make it harder to get into for some, but this is a point of preference, not quality.  Given, if you want or need those character driven stories or like to get filled in as you go, you won't like this series.

Personally, I enjoy both kind of stories and don't view one style as inferior or another superior, but I accept the style for it's strengths and enjoy them when they are well done.  In this case, it is VERY well done and INTENSELY enjoyable!

****Just a fantastic all around book! Great character development and a very engaging story. The romantic relationships tend to move a bit fast but not enough that it's too bothersome.

****complex and awesome with intertwined plot lines that make it so you can’t stop reading. Really hope they make it a series.

****Fantastic read. Inspiring characters and a web of intrigue. This series is an incredible experience

****Erikson's writing is something special.  It takes getting used to the fact that he spoonfeeds you nothing about the plot or the world but that makes the book all the more rewarding when you put the pieces together and draw the connections.  The characters are well written and relatable, the magic is vast and terrifying, and nothing seems off the table in terms of plot developments.  A must read for fantasy fans.

****One of the best I've read yet!

****Love these books!

****A+

****Before I grab a long epic read, I like to understand what I'm getting into. This 10 book epic is 3.5M words long! This first book has lovers and others that have weighed in with opinions. For me, Erickson hits it out of the park in every volume though you won't know how well until book 10.

Waiting on book 10:

The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts in Erickson's approach. As I read the book by book review of this epic by Amazon readers, they are not much help. None of the individual installments stand on their own but are a distinct reading pleasure within the total.

After reading nearly 10,000 pages of Malazan-world, you should understand that you are making a long term commitment of 100's of reading hours.  The good news - It's worth it ... stick it out. The bad news ... book 10 promises to close the epic.

I'm choosy in where I invest reading time in massive fantasy. I've been gyped. JRR Tolkien finished the first modern fantasy epic. How Erikson wraps up the 10,000 page epic should be a wonder.

Given the wonder, I cannot recommend this entertainment highly enough to you. After 10k pages, the mystery for me is whether it's 80% fantasy and 20% ScFi or vice versa or neither. The conclusion should answer that question. This work is interchangeably intensely dark and ineffably noble. The reader must glean the differences that are buried in the many levels of complexity as the story unfolds. Erickson's command of the language is the best I've ever seen and is subtly significant to the story. Philosophical threads are profoundly explored across the volumes. The reader is kept unsettled in distinguishing the nature of selflessly good and monstrous evil. Erikson's writing style pushes the readers own command of language to reveal the masterpiece that the Malazan books represent.

My only issue, and it's not trivial, is that the 10 book series really, really needs a reference companion. There are hundreds of characters, dozens of races, 300,000 years of active story,  a global map never revealed, and maps that might be the worst I've ever seen for following the volume being read. I gave up on trying to discern location, distance and destination language. Characters appear and disappear from the narrative but return two or three volumes later. This not normally an issue except that Erickson's characters are so vastly different and unique that a quick refresher is needed for reference.

BOOK 10 update:

Erickson closes the curtain on this magnificently entertaining  mega-epic after 3.5M words. Individually, each of the 10 volumes is 5-star, none stand better than another in their turn and they have kept this reader eager and wanting.  In total, the now complete 10 volume read is rather off the scale for a numerical rating in my humble opinion. I can't imagine that a fantasy reader can claim knowing the genre without completing the Tale of the Malazan. It's for that reason that relating the story in a review does an injustice for the masterpiece that I think will be the legacy in years to come. The Tale of the Malazan is simply too massive, too complex, too nuanced to be adequately related.

Erikson's style has remained on the edge of a kind of fantastical insanity with each volume. His style is disturbing and gritty at more levels of emotion, philosophy and logic then a reader might absorb. His mastery of characters is stunning in their entanglement in the tale. His mastery of the mind numbingly horrific opening line is rather unparalleled. The reader must strain to climb the wall of image intensity that Erikson paints in words, themes, characters and scale. Erikson's work is philosophical, psychological and compelling in the fantasy that he has so intricately woven.  Depravity, emotion and nature are unleashed in an assault on the reader's senses.

Through book 9, an ending was a great mystery and seemingly impossible to imagine. Book 10 would make or break all that Erikson had produced before. Book 10 quite simply delivers on all levels. The tapestry woven in the 10 volume story is absolutely stunning.

Bravo Steven Erikson!

****Erikson carefully reveals a complex and rich world in this first book while taking us through the battles, politics and characters involved in the Malazan Empire's war to control the last of the Free Cities. It has the feel of an epic-fantasy-thriller-mystery novel. Erikson's writing is among the best in fantasy and his world has a vast cast of characters: gods, sorcerers, soldiers, thieves, assassins, noble families, beasts and more.. An exciting start to a long series.

****I am about 2/3 in and love this book. From other reviews I thought I was in for trouble following characters/plot but that hasn't been the case at all. I found this very easy to follow and more importantly really enjoy reading it. Along with The Deathgate Cycle & The Hammer & Cross this is among my all time favorite series so far.

****Just having finished reading book 4 of the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan, I really needed a more fast pace book/series to take a break from the slower paced Jordan. A friend reccomended this book. I ordered it off of Amazon and looking at the cover, I figured it'd be a teenager blood and gore fantasy flick but fortunately I was wrong. This book goes just as deep as Jordan but does it a bit faster, quickly bringing you into Erikson's world filled w/ refreshing new characters and creatures. You can't really describe the basic motive behind the book in a couple sentences. It isn't a Good vs Evil book, because once you get to understand the different perspectives, you realize that each cause has its own reasons for doing the things that they do, both good and bad. It is extremely refreshing to read Erikson's work because it is unique. You can't just read the first 20 pgs and instantly know how the whole series will unfold.

I already ordered book two of the series and I eagerly await its arrival and once you enter Erikson's world, you'll know why.

An excellent book.

****After years spent gathering dust on my bookshelf, GARDENS OF THE MOON finally found its way onto my nightstand, having fought through piles of work-related and leisure reading materials.  A friend of mine had strongly recommended the series three or four years ago, and after the nice hardcover copy that I had immediately ordered arrived, it unfortunately became stalled in my ever-churning heap of books-to-read.  Still, this one has been on my radar as a highly-anticipated epic adventure.  Always being prominent in real-life bookstores, as well as here on Amazon, the Malazan Book of the Fallen series has long evoked a sense of postponed gratification and anxiety over my limited reading time.  The covers of the books alone promised a dark, fierce, and gritty fantasy that I assumed would take after Martin's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire/dp/0345529057">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>.  My friend's descriptions included phrases like "mind-blowing", "awesome", and "Freaking insanely bad-ass".  Well, the wait is over, and I've begun my journey through Erikson's massive saga.  And I am very happy to report that the writing, story, and setting are every bit as good as I had hoped.

The most striking aspect of GARDENS OF THE MOON is that Steven Erikson has absolutely no care for the reader's comfort, dropping you right into the middle of a complicated story that is already well underway.  Character motivations are rarely explained, a vast setting is suddenly exposed but not explored, a huge and confusing cast of characters from all manner of races is introduced with very little guidance, and mysteries abound in magic, lore, and history.  The general feeling during the first half of the book is one of confusion, where you'll feel like you must be missing key information, as every character seems to know more about what is going on than the reader.  You'll find yourself trying hard to remember many details, with the hope that you'll finally be able to get a grasp on what is behind the intense and deadly story.  While this aspect may sound frustrating, and many reviewers have docked stars from this book's rating, I found the abrupt entry into this world exciting and fun.  Knowing that there are huge pieces to the story that haven't been revealed, straining your brain to remember snippets of history, and pondering over the nature of the never-explained Warrens (the source of magic in the series), all gave this book a real and gritty feeling.  It was like I had been suddenly transported to this new and mysterious world without the benefit of an introduction.  Erikson's intentional refusal to hold the reader's hand might sound off-putting, but I found it refreshingly unique.

The story itself, which has only begun to unfold with GARDENS OF THE MOON, is incredible.  Vast empires, rebel armies, powerful sorcerers, and unearthly beings vie for power in a violent and quickly moving plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The magic is very much in-your-face compared to most dark epic fantasies.  Battling wizards lead to wholesale destruction, animated puppets and talking war-hounds stretch the imagination, and so-called gods interfering with mortal concerns calls for expecting the unexpected.  The setting is absolutely jam-packed with all manner of new races, human-like and not, living and undead, mortal and immortal.  Wonderfully imagined characters fill the pages of GARDENS OF THE MOON, with names like Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben, and Anomander Rake.  You get the feeling that most of their stories have already been told, but that this newest adventure will be the most desperate and thrilling yet.  Other characters like Crokus, Paran, and Sorry take on the mantle of the young would-be heroes just starting on their hopeful, yet disillusioned, adventures.  This series tells an incredibly large story that I am excited to have finally begun, and can hardly wait to continue with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Deadhouse-Gates/dp/0765348799">Deadhouse Gates</a>.

GARDENS OF THE MOON reminded me of why I love to read epic fantasies, and it made me glad to know that there are still wholly original stories to discover in a field of so many excellent and prolific authors.

Very highly recommended!

****This book feels like you're dropped into a brand-new world, one unlike anything you've ever seen before. The initial feeling I had was whiplash and confusion, since Erikson doesn't hold your hand or even explain much. He writes a story and expects you to keep up. Through paying attention and muscling on, I began to understand the world and the importance of the situations. Halfway through, I was hooked and furiously turning the pages to answer that all-important question, &#34;what happens next?&#34;

I honestly can't think of another book that was as much of an adventure for me, a reader, as this one. Sure, you have to pay attention and keep track of many novel concepts and diverse characters, but it's completely worth the investment. The climax itself was worth the previous 500 pages, and one of the most satisfying and impactful sequences in literature. Highly recommended for readers who want something unpredictable, well-written, and unforgettable.

****This was one heck of a fantasy novel! Though, you have to go slow and really pay attention to get the most out of it.

Erikson does a great job with his world building. It is complete with its own mythos, literature, peoples, and locations. And he drops you in it without so much a, How Do You Do. The best analogy for the way he introduces you to the world is if you happened upon a conversation in Central Park about the National League Division Series, and they were discussing the players' RBI, ERA, and OPS. And you know nothing about baseball, much less the teams. Heck you don't even know where Central Park is and what this &#34;New York&#34; place is and why is it New and what happened to the Old?

It's that confusing. I had to read the prologue three times and the first chapter twice just to stop my head form spinning. And everything is important. Like the poems that start the chapters, in most fantasy books I just skip those. But like Sanderson's Stormlight Archive the chapter headings play a larger part in the world building.

His characterization is spot-on. There is a very, very large cast, yet Erikson somehow keeps my emotional interest in most of them. I had several favorite characters that I was rooting for. The only problem was that they were all on different sides of the conflict and several times their interests were in conflict with one another. I just couldn't decide who I wanted to win. And I'm still not sure who are the &#34;Good Guys&#34; and who are the &#34;Bad Guys&#34;.

The action scenes are done wonderfully, and are many times as confusing and ambiguous as real battles are. No long drawn out fights for dramatic effect. They are typically quick and dirty and mean.

The only fault I found was the often the characters would get in these long philosophical thoughts that seemed to rant on the meaning of life and everything wrong with it. And it's not that I don't appreciate those at times, it just didn't seem to fit and I was beginning to wonder why everyone's thoughts were so morose.

All in all, an excellent fantasy novel. But it does need to be taken slow, and you do have to pay attention. But when you do, Erikson really rewards you for it.

****Yeah this book is hard to understand at first and may infuriate many readers. I was initially dumbfounded by the warrens and the multitude of characters. But something happened, around the half way mark I began piecing events together and then pretty soon I wasn't checking the character list as much. I wholeheartedly believe that this book is all the more rewarding because everything isn't handed to you on a silver platter. My advice is to just stick with it because the fights and imagery in this book are like nothing I've ever experienced. Characters are shattering mountains and wiping out entire armies, so when said characters clash on the battlefield it gives new meaning to the word epic. This book is unique because it has political intrigue much like Game of Thrones, while also magic and god-based action that makes characters like Gandalf look like little boys. Gardens of the Moon is the best fantasy book I have ever read (and I've read ASoFaI as well as the First Law Trilogy) and a completely unique reading experience.

****I have never read a story so convoluted and detailed.

It is clear from the reading that there is a strong RPG background.
Nevertheless, Steven Erikson must have been one of the best master or player ever existed.

The story is rich, vivid, to the point that you can even feel the smells of the situation.
There is no clear end, you never see the future of the path, as it can suddenly go opposite to what you were guessing.
The magic system is solid, the strain on the magic user palpable, there are costs associated to the use of magic.

No one is good, no one is bad, you get to like an assasin and to despise an holy priest.
Every decision taken will modify the balance of both the character morality and your perception of that character.

The plot is so well orchestrated, with countless actors all moving according to the direction.
One can only fathom at the mind that could handle all of this without losing track of it.
The background material necessary to sustain such a saga must be really vast.
I just hope some of it will be shared with the rest of us.

****I am now through book five of the series and I have really enjoyed Erikson's world.  This is an adult fantasy with complex plots, characters, history, magic, etc.  as others noted there are hundreds of characters to keep track along with different races of creatures - thanks to the malazan wiki it is easy to keep track of all of them.  I know this may be a considered heresy for the purest but it works great for me.

The books often start slow and, at times, you wonder if it is worth the time and effort to press on but then the story opens up and I get sucked into a fascinating world.  The world seems complete to me - cultures, religions and histories which Erikson reveals slowly through the series.  The books can stand alone but the story s revealed from book to book with common themes.  I particularly like his description/use of ascendents, gods and magic.  There is plenty of violence and brutality but that is not the primary focus

I strongly recommend using the malazan wiki to keep track of people, creatures, magic.  Without the wiki I would have given up on a great series.

Often I wonder where Erikson comes up with these ideas.

****This is a very fun read.  it's serious, but not overly so.  I really feel that Erikson's writing improved dramatically over the course of this book.  I didn't like the dialogue as much at first and even as the book went on, there were some lines that felt flat, but those became fewer and fewer as the book went on.  Once he shifts gears to some more interesting characters, however, the plots become more intricate and the way he weaves them together at the end is actually pretty amazing.  The fight at the end is pretty epic and I love how he's able to make magic feel like a truly powerful force in the world.  Once it's over, you'll probably want more.  I'm almost a third the way through the second book and it's even better so far.  As everyone has said, the world-building is excellent.

****It's so hard to find a fantasy series that stands out, and this series definitely does. I loved this world. I love the blending of the ancient greek and medieval English elements. The characters are complex--not boring old good vs. evil. I can't wait to keep reading this series. This world is like nothing I've ever encountered in books, TV or movies.

My BF introduced me to this series with the warning that Book 1 was Erikson's first book ever and was somewhat hard to follow. I can definitely see that, but it's almost endearing, especially with the introduction the author added in a later edition. (It reminded me of when I read LOTR as a kid and kept having to flip back and figure out the maps and appendices, since, frankly, LOTR has a lot of hard to follow rambling itself.)

My BF also said the books keep getting better, but I think the series has already started out great! I'm very excited to see how the next book is going to be better than this really great Book 1!

****I remember raving about this book to a family member. What struck me most was the way that the world is described with just enough vagueness as to bring wonder back to this genre of the kind I haven't felt since I was a teenager reading fantasy for the first time. Erikson manages to create a new and mysterious world with characters that are both larger than life and yet completely (somehow) believable. You can't help but love every single one.
There are several plot lines and a slew of characters, but they all end up essential to the story in a manner that leaves you reacting at the same pace as the characters.
Erikson also seems to use themes in his books, which I'm nerdy enough to find (or invent?) Gardens of the Moon speaks to me of random chance destroying the best laid plans.
In conclusion, if you don't like this book, you probably also don't like grilled onions and mushrooms...and I don't understand you, but to each his own.

****This is perhaps the most incredible fantasy I've ever read.  Bear in mind that I've read Jordan, Tolkien, Martin, Herbert, and Card.

This book, the first of a ten book series, is filled with incomparable magic and significant intrigue.  It is like a combination of Jordan and Martin, with a lot more magic.  The characters are developed carefully over the course of the story.  There is some level of similarity between many of them, but the subtlety conveyed is thick for each one of them.  It is well done imagination.  The writing has some small flaws, but that is insignificant in this book because you so thoroughly enjoy the elements presented that you do not really care if the prose is perfect or not.

I think my favorite character so far is a young girl who is named Sorry.  She's not all that she appears to be, though.  We encounter this girl early on in the book and she is transformed by some process of magic (which is left unexplained, and so open to imagination) and this development leaves the reader wondering what is to happen to Sorry, and what has she become.  But, that is not the limit.  There are many characterizations therein that require you to pay full attention.

As Stephen R. Donaldson says, "Steven Erickson afflicts me with awe."  I could not have said it better, myself.

Want an epic fantasy that will keep you up past midnight, yet forces you to take breaks so that you may consider all that has taken place over the course of reading?  Get this book.  Once you've read it, you will probably go after the entire series.  If the rest of the Malazan series is as good as this one, then I'm in for some very interesting times with Mr. Erickson.

****This is the first book of 10 book series.  This is a very rich, detailed story with characters I feel in love with.  It was very hard to get through this book as the author is not generous, at first, with details on the characters and past events in their lives.  He always leaves you wondering &#34;Did  I miss something, am I not getting it??&#34;  But the farther I went into the story, the more committed I became to finishing this book. And when I did, I immediately went in search of the 2nd book.  Over a period (while recovering from a severe surgery) of 6 months I read all ten books, and was disappointed there was not an 11th!  If you are fantasy genre lover, this book is for you!  I admit, this was a genre I had little experience with, but now I am searching for other authors that will fill me up as this author did!

****Perfect choice for Game of Thrones fans.

****Best fantasy book evar. I loved it. It was better than Cats. I want to read it again and again.

****Join the following.

****This book in MY OPINION is a really well written, with good character development and back story.  The author didn't seem to draw out the story and I didn't notice any inconsistencies during my first read through.

If you are a fan of fantasy novels I would recommend at least giving this book a try before diving into the rest of the series (I have the second book on order!).

That said, the one major thing I found confusing was remembering the different species/gods in the novel.  There are quite a few and as they are referenced and appear in the novel it can be difficult to keep track of who is who.  I'm really glad the author included a glossary as this helped with some of the confusion early on.

TL;DR  Really good book, I would recommend it to any fantasy reader.

****Excellent series

****I am sure there are far more eloquent reviewers who have commented on this work, and I will leave the flowing verbose reviews to them. I will, however, say this...

If you are like me and can devour a fantasy novel in 3 hours, then pick up Gardens of the Moon. Erikson just drops you in the middle of his world and makes you hang on his every word to orient yourself. The world he builds is rich and beautiful. Once I finally figured out who the characters were and such, I was at the end of the novel... So I immediately read it a second time through. I was looking for a challenge when I picked up this book. I can't wait to tackle the other 9 in the series.

****his is a book that I've been wanting to review for ages.  In fact, in some ways, Erikson was the genesis of this here blog.  I've been writing about fantasy since I was in highschool.  My Junior Year Position Paper was on C.S. Lewis.  The next year, my paper was on the genre as a whole.  But after voraciously devouring this series and its genre busting all-out action, I knew things had changed in the genre as a whole.  I stopped reading fantasy in college.  I started dating, made friends, and basically didn't have the time.  Years later, bartending in New York, and living in Harlem I had a lot of time to myself again, and I started to reread some of the classics on my shelf.  I had no interest in new fantasy.  I figured the genre had gone to Forgotten Realms and DragonLance knock offs.  Erikson made me a believer again.

I've tried to turn people on to this book, and this series, to no avail.  And not to &quot;Norms&quot; (non-fantasy readers) to bonafide sword-swinging fantasy lovers.  This series is so good I had to take notes while reading it again so I'd remember all the ideas within that I'd wanted to explore.  So I'm going to abandon the usual format.  The format, afterall, is intended to provoke critical thought.

Kalam, Quick Ben, Whiskeyjack
First of all, Gardens of the Moon, though the first in the series, The Malazan Book of the Fallen, is an intermission.  I think this may be why so many people have trouble getting into it.  It starts after a massive battle, after an emperor was assasinated, after a city has fallen.  Much of the book is getting the characters from the remains of one city to the next on the new Empress hit list.  There are other reasons of course.  The scope of this world is enormous.  That's one of the fantasy five, and Erikson gets full marks.  His world is enormous and intricate.  This is not surprising.  He and a friend developed the world as a game a la Dungeons and Dragons.  It should also be noted that Erikson (his pen name) was an anthropologist.  As someone who is married (yes!  as of a months ago) to an anthropologist, I know just how much is crammed into their heads.  Each people of this world is intricate and fully developed straight out of the gate.  Another reason why this is an intermission is because Erikson wastes little time on explanation.  Single, dense phrases are used to describe entire peoples.  And there are literally over two hundred of them, from the plains dwellers on Genabackis, the Rhivi, to the denizens of the Seven Cities, to the Gral, to the fishing people of Quon Tali, the sophisticated Daru, and the imperially minded Malazans.  All those names are confusing, and that turns a lot of people off.  It is very easy to miss important details, things that occur, pivotal moments described in a single sentence, and moved on only to be referred to again and again with no explanation.  Still the important thing to remember when reading this epic, is that you don't always need to pay attention to these names.  This series is a series to re-read, to parse, to explore.  Get what you can, and have faith that Erikson will explain further in due time.  It might take to the seventh volume of the series, but he has never contradicted himself that I can see, so be patient and keep reading.  The really good stuff doesn't even occur until the third volume, Memories of Ice.

Anomander Rake - Son of Darkness
Before I get further into my notes, let's hit some of the basics.  Like in Jordan's works, there are literally hundreds of characters, so this is a plot driven story.  That said, given the sheer number of words in over ten volumes, many characters emerge extremely well developed.  The story starts with a character named Gannoes Paran, he's young, good looking, and you expect him to be the story's main hero.  Not so, because there is no main hero.  This is an ensemble cast, and there half a dozen main characters at least.  There is an evil empire, the Malazan Empire, which isn't really that evil, or much of an empire it turns out.  But none of the soldiers of that Empire are evil, they're just men, and this is, among other things, a soldier's novel, about companionship, and loyalty in the ranks.  But the Empire is the backdrop for something much much larger, which is really only hinted at in the first book, and in fact, is not even given a name to in the first of the series.

Another thing that's great about the series is the magic system.  One of the Fantasy Five, magic.  It's completely unexplained in the first book, but it's astonishing.  The book opens with a battle between a planet sized asteroid hovering hundreds of feet in the air, and five arch-mages sending corruscating waves of power into the sky.  The typical magic cliche for fantasy is -- the big stuff doesn't play until the end.  Until then, its all parlor tricks and smokescreens.  Another cliche ripped to pieces

Ok, so onto the nitty-gritty.  This is a discussion for Moon readers.  So stop now if you haven't read the book.  Adjunct Lorn.  Why did she have to die?  I rather liked the character of the stern, attractive, warrior woman, and thought she would have made a better partner to Gannoes.  The reason I ask is because Erikson indeed revives characters with impunity, having killed Gannoes in the first 50 pages, Tattersail and sending Toc the Younger off into a mysterious chaos warren.  Lorn was a fascinating character with a fascinating weapon, her Ottatoral sword.  But then again, Erikson refers to himself as a cliche breaker, and having Gannoes end up falling for the fat mage Tattersail, is a real change of pace for any genre, much less fantasy.

Hedge and Fiddler, Bridgeburners
One of the central mysteries of the first book is the assassination of the old Emperor.  Who did it?  Why?  Is the Emperor really dead, and what about his cronies, are they dead too, like Toc the Elder, or Daseem Ultor?  It's an interesting frame for the series.  Many of these questions don't even get answered in Moon, but are answered in the sequel Deadhouse Gates, and in many ways the entire series strives to answer these questions.  Along the same lines, is the idea that the Bridgeburners, the seminal unit of the Malazan Army that is known far and wide must also die.  I regret this, there are only about seven of them left to begin with, and they all seem to be great characters.  Still, the series is called the Malazan Book of the Fallen, and if Malazans didn't fall, well, what would be the point?

Next topic: The Deck of Dragons.  So Erikson takes the game of Tarot and makes it real.  It's an unbelievably clever mechanism for the story, it adds a ton of depth, and a ton of detail.  However, it does make the story denser and harder for the lite-fantasist to glom onto.  The Deck of Dragons is a playing deck of all the gods and demi-gods in the saga's pantheon.  They're organized into aligned houses, and unaligned houses.  And when characters like Tattersail give a reading, it often reveals what Gods are at play in the field.  All the houses, and the players in each deck are noted at the beginning of the first book.  This cheat is not repeated in later books.

Another very divergent aspect of Erikson's work is his quixotic narrators.  Calling them narrators is a bit misleading, they are characters, who often speak in riddles, or long nearly non-sensical rants that seldom make sense to the other players, but which are more often directed at the reader.  Each book has such a character, but the one in Gardens is none other than Kruppe.  Kruppe is a fat, balding little wizard who is a master thief, and we find out during the book, quite a powerful mage.  However, his persona is one of befuddlement and misdirection, and even his greatest friends seldom realize that their actions and thoughts are directed entirely by the mischievous Kruppe.  This fat wizard also provides the book with its greatest sense of comic relief.  These narrative voices are almost always comedic and poke fun at both the author, and his characters.  You get a sense of the author himself, or at least, who the author might like to be, as these characters, in addition to being funny, are almost always really good natured as well.

This is another aspect which deserves exploration:  Erikson is a master of good and evil.  It sounds trite, and I'm sure that he would prefer to think of himself as a trend breaker, but fantasy is about good and evil, Gods of Dark, Swords of Light.  In this Erikson doesn't break the trend, he masters it.  You may recall from a prior review of Naruto, that the character of the young Ninja is extremely good, happy, kind, and despite his idiocy, his heart is warm and caring for all.  The good--in the Erikson novels--is similar.  However, Gardens of the Moon, is less of an exploration of good and evil than his later novels.  Still you get flashes of it through characters like Kruppe and his companions, Gannoes love for Tattersail, Tattersail's heartwrenching guilt about previous monstrosities committed under imperial writ.

Ok, just a few last points:  There are many characters, including the &quot;hero&quot; Gannoes, and the anti-hero Lorn, who are forced continually to sublimate their will.  They act for the good of the empire, of which they are committed agents.  Sergeant Whiskeyjack of the Bridgeburners who is offered the chance to retire, flee certain death because of his love and loyalty of his comrades, and their own love for him.  This sublimation of the will, can be seen as character building, but it also exerts an exceedingly destructive force.  When Lorn finds out that Tattersail was the agent responsible for atrocities committed in Malaz City, the girl, shorn of her previous life, reemerges from her imperial shell, the illustrious general Dujek Onearm reminds her of her current responsibilities, and that she herself is the second in command to none other than the woman who commanded the purge.  Of course, these events are all historical, past events that are mere artifacts to the story, but the sheer depth is staggering.  And I'm in love with it.  I want to unearth the entire history of this continent that goes back over two-hundred thousand years.

Penultimate point:  Dragnipur.  How cool is that?  A massively powered sword, that itself harbors a magical realm of pain and imprisonment, where a massive cart is pulled by a single Atlas like godling.

Ultimate point:  Erikson stories as we'll discover are all about convergence.  This I think qualifies as a cliche, but Erikson is the first that I've read to be so open about it.  Jordan's books use the same cliche, the Wheel of Time books always end with a convergence.  So what does this mean?  A convergence is a meeting of fell powers, the climax of every story, where all the pivotal characters meet for their hour of greatest conflict.  What makes Erikson's convergences so remarkable?  The sheer scope of the powers involved.  Even now, I recall vividly the ending of the Sword of Shannara, and the half-elf Shea's meeting with the evil wizard.  Those powers were great and scary, buy Shea was a quiet, hobbit like character with no real power's of his own.  As a brief aside, Japanese horror movies, and anime is very similar, and in fact may be the progenitor for this sort of convergence.  The powers that meet are colossal, far greater than human, far greater than mere wizard or swordman.  The forces that converge in an Erikson novel are titanic in nature.  And astonishing.  As an aspiring author, it makes me weep with jealousy.  The depths of horror, the depths of love, the depths of friendship and loyalty, seem to be unsurpassable.

So.  If you can get through all the names, if you can get through all the lands and peoples and characters, if you can look beyond the things you don't yet know, and enjoy it for what it is, the rewards are entirely worth it.  Buy this book.

Note:  I intend to add photos to this soon, so check back!

****Although this was written some time ago it was my first experience of this guy, very complicated but what a brilliant story the characters; well you could imagine them and the story concept totally original in the most part, Will now buy and read all the series and the advantage of picking this series up now means I can read them in story order not in written order as that's different.

****With the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, Steven Erikson has created on of the best fantasy worlds i have ever experienced. The first book might be a bit much at times, as it introduces a lot of characters and various story lines, but they all neatly tie up in the end and over the entire series all characters are explored and explained in depth. Steven Erikson does not spend 200 pages on pagantry, he describes the important parts of scenery and surroundings, but then he moves on to narrating events and dialogue. His characters talk frequently, and when they do they sound real, with all the emotions one could expect and hope for.

I can highly recommend the entire series to any fantasy fan out there, and the first book is a fun and entertaining read.

****I started Gardens of the Moon off a recommendation from some friends a few years back, and ordered (I believe) the first three books all at once.  I decided to jump in whole hog and get into this world that everyone else had gotten into.

Well, I started reading Gardens of the Moon, and ... sheesh.  I thought I'd thrown that money down the drain.  I had a hell of a time getting into it, but pressed on.  This is a dense, dense novel, with dozens of characters, a confusing plot, terms I didn't understand, and a shaky sense that *something* is going on, if only I could figure out *what*.

In short, starting Gardens of the Moon is a bit like being thrown into the deep end when you barely know how to swim.

Erikson's not an author who takes it easy on the reader.  There are very few expository sections or "info-dumping" conversations between characters where they discuss stuff they already know very well in order to convey information to you, the reader.  No; he throws you into the Malazan world head-first, and expects you to tread water and figure out what's going on.  (For example, I don't think he explains what a "warren" is until maybe the sixth or seventh book out of 10, by which time the reader probably has figured out a lot on their own.)  There aren't too many throwaway lines or passages, either; incidental stuff can (and does) become important later on.  It's not a book you can skim... Well, you *can*, but you'll probably hate every minute.  Erikson said in an interview that he writes novels as if they were short stories, and IMO, they almost need to be read with that same sensibility.

Anyway!  I made it through that first read, and even mostly enjoyed it.  I even thought I was starting to figure it out, too.  By the time I finished reading Deadhouse Gates, I was hooked.  Back then, right after the first read, I probably would have given Gardens of the Moon three or so stars.  It had some really interesting ideas (such as a neat take on, "what would someone who'd lived three hundred thousand years think like?") but that was about it.  It was funny in parts, grim and others, but generally felt rather arbitrary and random.

The reason I'm giving this book five stars *now* is largely what I consider the most amazing part of the series.  It's intensely, astonishingly richer on a second, third, or - heck! - fourth read, after digesting later installments.  On each re-read, it gives you some new perspectives...  It's almost like a new book again.  That apparent arbitrariness and randomness?  Well, it all makes logical sense, too, after you get a few books into the series, to the point where you can say, "Well, yeah, I could have seen THAT coming."  I can't say that about too many other books I've read.

The Malazan series has its critics, and I can't really say they're *wrong.*  It takes a certain sort of person to enjoy these, and Erikson does have his faults as an author.  But, for my money, this series is about as good as epic fantasy gets.  It's high fantasy pulled down to earth.

****As a fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, The First Law Series, and The Gentleman Bastards I was looking for a new series to dive in to. The book throws you in to a very complex world right off the bat. Erikson doesn't pull any punches with the narrative. Well written and engaging. I'm ready dive into the next book.

****From recommendation by a friend, I decided to have a look at this book series famous for challenging the reader and steering clear of most of the stereotypical fantasy characters and themes. I was thrilled to find out the fame it had earned was not overrated. One of the things worth mentioning is how Erikson seems to consider how magic, gods and mythical creatures would affect warfare, tactics, strategy and politics if they were real. It reminded me of good scifi writers like Heinlein who always seems to have a good insight on how hypothetical situations would roll out.
Word of warning however, the book series is in places very violent and should be avoided if this is a problem to you.

****I'm not sure how to rate the sexual content; don't take my rating verbatim on that.

Amazing writing, very much looking forward to the other books in the series when I get them, after I finish this one.

****On my second read after a long hiatus from the series.  If you liked Wheel of Time check this out.

****I am just into this book and loved it from the first paragraph.  In my ind the hallmark of a master of this art is character development and substantial, deep mood setting.  That's what separates the geniuses from the hacks.  Evoking the presence of the characters, their worries and perceptions, and the feel of their world...which means the plot itself develops slowly.

Erikson nails it.  The only other other I have read who compares, and in fact reminds me of him a great deal, is CJ Cherryh.  If you like Cherryh you'll love Erikson.

****What a fantastic book, deep plot line, likeable characters, nice action scenes, and a lot is happening when you don't know it. Reading further in the book makes the previous sections clearer. Fun read, can't wait for book two!

****This is the first book in a dark fantasy series. It follows the Malazan campaign to conquest the north of the Genabackis continent and the last standing of the Free Cities. The empire itself is in a turmoil, the empress paranoia is reaching far and her Claws are infiltrated everywhere. Nobody can be trusted and almost everyone seems to have a hidden identity and a secret past. The Malazan army is opposed by an alliance of forces with very different objectives, but a common enemy. This setup cannot be ignored by the mighty gods and they do try to exercise their influence whenever is possible. What will be the outcome? Read on to find out.

****So much content I had to reread most beginning sections.  The pace was interesting with new characters, magic, and unexplained locations, people, and events.  it was great after page 200.  Has some interesting thoughts on mortality and immortality.  Check it out.  If you like it, you will love it and want to talk about it.

****I hesitate to review books I really enjoy, because I struggle to define exactly what it is I love and write something other than 'why are you not reading this book already omgggggg' (only with more caps lock)  With Gardens of the Moon, the first book in the Malazan series, I honestly did not know what I thought of it when I reached the end.  I read the entire thing, set it down, and went, 'what did I just read?'  I wasn't certain about the world, I didn't really relate to any of the characters, and I figured I'd not touch the rest.  It kept eating at me though until I bought the second book and now I'm hooked.

The prose gets a bit thick at times.  The world requires you to think in order to keep up.  The magic is more intuition than explanation.  The plot is not straight-forwards and there are lots of seeming sub-plots. This is not what I would call an easy read.  If you're okay with not having everything presented to you, then this book is certainly worth it.  It's an interesting and complex world.  It's dark, to the point where it hurts to read.  I pause between each book and read something light and easy to give my mind a break before starting the next.  I imagine it's going to be a love it or hate it book for a lot of people.  If you decide to try it, stick it out until the end, wait a few days, and then decide whether or not you want to continue.  It took some time for me to realize I was still interested and after that, I've been absolutely riveted.

****I really didn't know what to expect when I first picked up this book but I'm glad I did. A lot of reviews said that this was the hardest to get through and if that's the case then I can't wait for Deadhouse Gates. The amount of characters and plots makes this book what it is because frankly I'm bored of books being dumbed down for a specific audience. Erikson makes it clear that either your going to absolutely love his books or your going to hate it. However if you love books like A Game of Thrones or any of The Legend of Drizzt series I highly recommend Malazan Book of the Fallen.

****This is the first book out of the 150 or so I've read through kindle that I've bothered to review, and just that should tell you something.

This book is by far one of the best ones I've read, easily on par with The Godslayer Chronicles, and The Gentleman Bastards.

That'll have to do for this review, now I have to buy the second book.

****I'm definitely gonna rate this book as a 5 stars one. I enjoyed every bit of it but I can see why people are pretty much annoyed by it. The reason is simple - reader is thrown into the story and there is no pampering or handholding through it. From the beginning you have no idea whats happening but as the story reveals one can see an epic work behind it.
I would recommend this book to anyone who wanna read true epic fantasy book (series) and have enough patience to let the author tell it.

****Where do I start...

Pick this book up. Get it on your Kindle or find the hard copy.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, but one of those books is the ONLY book I've EVER cried to (yes, in real life) while reading. No, I won't name which book. Suffice it to say that you, dear reader, will be exposed to moments of pathos severe enough to strip away the armor of your heart and expose your soul to its compassion, love and pain.

There's sadness in the books... but there's happiness too. Hope, despair, glory, tragedy, victories, failures... it's all blended in to a series which takes me for a ride every time I dive in.

I may be scorned for this but it could be the very best fantasy I've ever read (and that includes Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and Brooks (and others). Steven Erikson weaves a tale that left and continues to leave me breathless.

There's only one obstacle you need to know about: the "epic" nature of the series. It has its own index of characters. It starts you out in the middle (in medias res) of the story similar to Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey. Much is similar between Erikson and Homer. Luckily (for me, anyway) Steven Erikson chose not to write in that iambic pentameter prose.

So at times, you may be lost or confused as to why you're being introduced to some character or storyline you've never heard of before. I hope that you read and make your way through the story so that you can say "Whoa, so those people did all that? So this person is really THAT person from that book? ...Unbelievable." You'll get to those points. Those points and more as you experience Erikson's masterpiece.

Yeah, I'm obsessed with the series. After all, have YOU ever read a series that made you actually show your emotions in real life? I have and it's this series.

Go right now and get it. You won't be disappointed.

****While I think this book is great and I would recommend it to a reader, I would not recommend the entire 10 book series. There are some real terrible books after the 4th in the series.

But this is a great series, very much in the D&D meets Glenn Cook's the Black Company feel.

Again this is a long series with some horrid follow-ups, but you will love the first four books, but then you will be stuck reading a terrible book horrid book 5 an ok book 6 a bad book 7 an ok book 8 and 9 and a decent book 10.

Start at your own risk.

****I'll preface this by saying I've read the entire series.  I stuck through the whole thing right until the conclusion.  What did I find?  I found an incredible world unparalleled in scope.  I found characters who lived and breathed.  I found emotion that few books are able to evoke.  I also found confusion.

I'll start off with the bad.  This entire series is convoluted and nigh impossible to understand in one go.  Nothing is explained in this series.  Everything just is.  I read 10 books of this stuff and I still could not even truly begin to explain to you how the magic system works, and I promise you the magic system is very prevalent in the series.

Then you have plotlines.  I lack the words to describe how horrid the structure of this novel is.  If you think of a normal epic as having many plotlines which weave together to form a beautiful tapestry, you'll best understand the Malazan series as a tangled mess with no shape and some of the strings strewn about on the side.  Things happen and they don't make sense.  The ending of the series is beautiful but at the same time is nothing.  A character we haven't heard from in two books does something across the world with no foreshadowing whatsoever and it has a major effect on the end of the story.  This doesn't make sense and it's a bit disappointing.

That said, the good.  The story is good.  It may be a tangled mess, but it is one beautiful tangled mess.  Once you finally find your feet you will enjoy where the story takes you.  I think this is mainly due to the characters.  Some of them are hit and miss, but when Erikson hits, it's a home run.  I truly cared about many of the characters and reading about them was a blast.  Some of them are misses, but this is rare.

This is a series you'll truly have to work for.  If you want casual reading then stay away.  Don't buy this book because you'll hate it.  You have to really want this series to be good and you have to put in the effort.  I do not mean reading 100-200 pages, I mean reading 1000 pages before things start jumping out.  I thought the entire series was pretty mediocre or even bad until I got to the third book, easily 1500 pages into the series.  If you're willing to strive to be enveloped in the world, I'd be hard-pressed to find a better fantasy series and I've read quite a few.  There is a masterpiece here if you can find it.

****If you like to read books that are in a series you should definitely read the Malazan Book of the Fallen. I have no idea how there can be so many bad ass characters that are so different from each other, but Erikson and Esslemont have done it.  This is the only book series I'll admit to having felt like crying more than once while reading.  You get to know the characters as if they are real people, and when they die it hurts.

****Absolutely loved this book and have started through the rest of the series.

I found it quite an adult book compared to some fantasy which, though good, does feel like it appeals to a younger audience too.

There's lots going on and quite a range of characters and their stories. A very rich history to the world and a new approach to magic - at least from my reading experience.

****This book has 666 pages in it. That should mean something to anyone about to buy it. This book is one of the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read, for one reason. There are dragons. There, I said it. BUY IT!

****A complex and fascinating novel where you aren't sure who to root for until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed the wide array of characters and plotlines. Everything intertwines although it took awhile to for some of the plots to come to completion. Ive already bought book 2 in anticipation of seeing where it all goes. I suspect that future plotlines will bring back some of the characters who went their separate paths. Thoroughly enjoyable.

****This book caught hold of me from the first paragraph. The world building in it is stunning and creative. The characters are memorable and genuine. Definitely worth reading.

****You know if you like fantasty books. I tried broadening my reading base to include modern non-fiction, classical literature, or historical fiction and I always come back to fantasy. This book satisfied my craving quite nicely. I'm listening to the first book of A Song of Fire and Ice, and so far I like Erikson's Gardens of the Moon better.

****While I admit it took me almost a year of off an on reading to get into this book, I can not say enough good things about Steven Erikson's Malazan series. I carry a book with me everywhere I go and even try to read while I'm walking from one place to another. High engrossing. Stick with it and I promise you will grow to love it.

****As a fan of fantasy fiction books, I discovered this series late in the game. I had heard it was difficult to get into and I noticed it had some mixed reviews. I must say that after reading it, I can't believe the number of negative reviews I've seen!

*No spoilers*

This book is absolutely captivating! Sure, there is a lot to get into. What reader doesn't need some time to understand the structure and rules of a fantasy world existing only in the author's mind? As creations go, this one is very close to topping my all time favorites list! It is wonderfully complex and original. It opens before the reader one fascinating piece at a time, giving hints at the full scope of things while allowing the reader to digest and speculate of what he or she has seen so far. I actually like the fact that we don't get to know everything all at once. It keeps things interesting and dramatic.

I tend to compare all fantasy fiction to Robert Jordan. Erikson is not nearly so loquacious and yet still conveys an excellent sense of the atmosphere during the events of the novel. The perspective of the novel is less constrained than Jordan or Martin, jumping between characters when appropriate, and makes the novel much more intriguing. The characters personalities are distinct and full while somehow remaining... human. I like the fact that no one side is really identified as the "good guys." There are shades of gray in each faction, giving the novel a touch of real life. After all, who doesn't start to feel differently about the Seanchan later on in the "Wheel of Time," when we get to see their perspective?

The pace of this book is another plus. While there is pretty much constant action happening throughout the story (unlike the painful lead-up to awesome climax in Jordan's novels), there is still enough calm periods to effectively prepare the reader for the exciting climaxes. Understanding that this novel is the first of many, the ending is also quite good. Giving some closure while leaving enough unanswered questions and mystery to entice the reader to jump into part 2. Unlike books 4 and 5 of the Game of Thrones (which pretty much killed the series for me), I can't wait to keep reading!

I am not a quick reader. I tend to savor the books I love. Diving into the fantasy world and making full use of my imagination as I read. That being said, I finished this one rather quickly, because I couldn't put it down! I give this one two enthusiastic thumbs up!

****This is an amazing and complex adventure with intriguing characters and plots that mold into one. The action and magic is second to none. Thrones is mundane in comparison. Can't wait to start Deadhouse Gates. This book was just the first foot off a boat named Enskalander to a whole new world!

****One of the best books..and series of books...I have ever read. Only LOTR and the Song of Ice and Fire even compare!

****I found this title while searching for something that could satisfy my hunger for depth and grit while I awaited the next installment in GRRMs "A Song of Ice and Fire".  I had begun feeling like there just wasn't anything in the fantasy genre that could come close to the "grown up" feel of that series and though I enjoy reading the novels put out by other contemporary fanasy writers, I have been deeply spoiled by the refreshingly grey-scale world woven by Martin.  In searching for other contemporary fantasy authors that could engender in me the same depth of feeling and suspense that Martin has, I came across several lists in which "Gardens of the Moon" (and it's subsequent volumes) were listed alongside the titles that I have come to deeply enjoy.  My first taste of Erikson was a pleasant one indeed.

In this book you will find very little in the way of clear-cut good and evil (even a demon can be cute in this world when it is kept as a pet) but you will find much of the refreshing shades of grey that make the world feel real despite it's fantasy heritage.  The cast is huge and the races are many, and I'll admit it can be daunting at times.  That said, the author never seems to talk "down" to you or insult your intelligence with ultra-convenient and utterly unbelievable plot twists.  In addition, the book engenders a rare but true feeling of suspense brought on by the fact that the main characters are not necessarily going to make it alive...one of the main things that made Martin's books so great to me.  The question then becomes "will he get out of this" rather than "how will he get out of this."

On the downside, it can be difficult to keep track of what race is what and who is on who's side, but some of that can be attributed to the fact that many of the characters are simply on their own side, rather than backing the cause of one of the main fighting influences in the story.  I also get the feeling that as you continue with this series, much of this will become more familiar as I was much more accustomed to following the goings-on by the end of the book than I was in the beginning.

In summary, with a little grit, a lot of sorcery, some sword and a fair measure of intelligence, Erikson has managed to pen a tale that truly is fit to rub shoulders with the likes of the best the fantasy genre has to offer and leaves the overwhelming majority of his contemporaries in the dust.  And while he's not Martin, he's comparable and he writes faster -- meaning I'll have something to read and keep me happy while I patiently wait for Martin to shuffle into his publisher with the next installment of ASOIAF in tow.  I highly recommend Gardens of the Moon.

****A great book for fans of game of thrones, lord of the rings, and high fantasy books. Lots of complex characters and plot lines that are brought together in a well written entry into an amazing fantasy series. Tor has really good re-reads/chapter summaries if at times the plot gets too confusing.

****Great action to be the first half of the day you can get it right away with the best of the day after a long day at the same thing to say it was the best of the best way of the best thing to say it was the best thing to say it is not the same thing as the first half of the day after a long day at the same time as the best of luck with the best thing ever I go back and I don't think that I can see it

****I'd have to put this up near the top of my favorite books of all time...at least in this genre. It's rare to read a book that almost makes you feel like you're really there. Be warned that there are a lot of characters and it can be a challenge to keep up, but to me it was well worth the effort.

****I loved this first book, it took me a bit to remember all the characters within the first book. I highly recommended this book for those who like magic, soldiers and a fight between empires. This book has it all an in-depth plot and characters. I have to admit it took me awhile to get into this book but stick with it worth it in the end. I can't wait to see how this story plays out.

****GREAT series! I was introduced to the author by some friends I game with. Incredibly well written, complex yet very satisfying. If you are looking for a new medieval fantasy series to start, then I would highly recommend this one.

****I read twice the whole serie and my first impression remains: they are a masterpiece of modern fantasy. The second time I enjoyed much more the use of the language, the  whole structure of the books and the depth of the characters ideology. Somehow feels like they are written to  challange the lector in more ways than just looking in a dictionary for unknown words.

****I had no idea what was going on for the first ten chapters, but as the story continues I found my self not being able to put the book down. Likeable characters, realistic emotions, crazy awesome idea of magic and gods messing around with s*** what's not to love?

****Depth and detail. Great read, can't believe I hadn't heard of this before. Well balanced, definitely not a simple or quick read.

****Steven has pulled together a fresh and imaginative world. Great job a fan fan forever. Bridge burners forever. Awesome story

****If you are a fan of the series &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;, you'll love this book. It has a winding plot that doesn't disappoint when it comes to complexity and depth. I highly recommend it! I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!

****I have just started to read this series, and I found this book to be great! I am a fan of the Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire series. But this world is well constructed, the story is beautifully written, the battle scenes are awesomely descriptive. I may have very well found a favorite series that I can read more and more!

****I was looking around for something similar to Glen Cook's Black Company series.

I saw the Malazan series recommended on a few different sites, so I gave it a try.

Epic is an understatement. While the first three books of the Black Company were good, the rest of the series was good, but not great.

I'm now on book eight of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, and I can safely say, the story only gets better.

I'm powering my way through the entire series, I haven't read much else since I started these books. They are long, but they pay off.

Erikson uses the same recipe in most of the books. Set up a series of almost seemingly unrelated stories and characters. Then through the story slowly bring them closer and closer until they all meet in an epic ending.

One of the major themes is confluence. How the use of power draws other powerful entities.

Every book has a satisfying conclusion. Yet, characters may drop out for a book or two only to reappear later in unexpected places.

All in all, better than the Black Company series. Be warned though, you may get confused but all the characters coming and going.

I found it helpful to lookup the occasional reference on the various malazan wikis. Most of the time, spoilers are clearly labeled, so you can get some basic character info without ruining any surprises.

****Hooked me and several friends on the series.

****I said some sexual content but overall is almost non-existent. What is there is brief mentions and done tastefully.  I'm at the end of the second book now and it's a little tedious but good.  Several of my friends that have read the whole series say that the first two books are good but awesome from book three on.

****Awesome freaking book!!!  This is what Game of Thrones wants to be when it grows up!!!  And best of all???  THEY'RE ALL WRITTEN!!!  NO WAITING AROUND FOR THE AUTHOR TO STOP WRITING COOKBOOKS OR KIDDIE BEDTIME STORIES AND PRAYING HE DOESN'T DROP DEAD OF A MASSIVE CORONARY!!!  The entire Malazan Book of the Fallen is done.

****Liked it enough to buy the next book as soon as I finished this one

****If you're here reading reviews of this book, you probably already know what the whole series is about and how epic is Erikson's story, how elaborated is his world and how thoughtful is his writing. That as fine a craft it can get in this fantasy genre. So let's skip the praising.

If ever there is something that may deter you from buying this book, I'd bet is the hearsay about how confusing and difficult is the reading. Please, pay no mind to it!

It is, indeed, a baffling effort at the beginning, but not without a purpose. What Erikson did here was intended: the reader is thrown into a vivid world, amid a horrid war, and is not spoonfed by any means. But it is all there! The thread is carefully sewn here and somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3 of the story you'll find yourself totally hooked by it. I can't think of any reading as satisfying as this!

Give it a chance and heed the motifs of this grand story. It certainly revolves around compassion (or the lack of it) and humanity. In this wondrous scheme of gods and men, it is a delight to watch the inner journey of characters drawed by humankind warring proneness.

****My all time favorite series

****Great read, lots of plot and world building. The characters are fully realized and intriguing, can't recommend this to fantasy fans enough.

****The book itself is amazing: beautiful (and often underrated) writing; a rich, complex story; and amazing settings and characters. The paperback edition is well made, and after two teenagers reading through it there are no noticeable wrinkles or creases in either the cover or the pages.

****I could write a book on how much I enjoyed this book and this series. It really is brillant! It is not for everyone however. The author assumes the reader is intelligent and doesn't spoon feed you information. This allows you to figure things out for yourself. Which I really enjoy.

****This book is just the beginning of an excellent series. New and innovative high fantasy. The story keeps the excitement level up and the character building is phenomenal.  I put this series of books on my top ten list of all times.

****You jump into the middle of a story, but once you get your teeth into it you wont want to let go.  The hardest part when starting is switching between the stories in the different books. This is by far my favorite fantasy series.

****Takes some time to get into. The author doesn't take ant time to ease you into the world or teach you th  rules. I felt like I only understood 10-20% till about half way through. But we'll worth the confusion once it come together.

****As heroic as Lord of the Rings; far more subtle than Game of Thrones; welcome in its lack of judgement.  The third time you read all ten it will make even more sense.

****This book seems to be a bit polarizing by the reviews.  I don't know how a hardcore fantasy reader could dislike it.  Awesome book.  Great because there are so many badass characters and there is clearly a lot of thought put into the world.  Reminds me of the Black Company by Glenn Cook with more magic and more unknowns. If you don't understand everything at first, just keep reading and you'll be able to put the pieces together. I'm reading the 2nd book now and still loving it.

****Wonderful book, I've been a fan of Erikson's for years and have recently taken up the quest of rereading the series again. I highly recommend it.

****Nice start to this series.  A bit more confusing than I expected, with a lot of moving parts.  I would have liked more details about the races, but it looks like they will come at the right time.  Moving on to the next book.

****The book is great! It arrived cracked at the top though.Please pack it better next time.

But seriously though, maybe the best fantasy series of all time.

****Beautiful, vivid descriptions and complex, believable characters.  Not for you if you need exposition - throws you right into the story, figure it out as you go.

****One of the best fantasy series available if you don't expect all your main characters to survive. Believable world but you need to concentrate to follow all the characters and subplots. Definitely not a light read!

****There are a ton of characters, and while it can be a bit confusing at times, if you stick with this story you will be greatly rewarded.  Action, battles,magic, assassins, and politics all wrapped up in an epic story.

****Great book, but a little hard to follow at the beginning but as the story progresses pieces fall into place about what a lot of the titles and descriptions of the magic and cultural aspects of the book are about.

****best fantasy saga of all time and this is where it all started.  treat yourself..buy this book and enjoy the journey.

****This is right up at the top with "the name of the wind", and "the dragon bone chair".  Erikson spins a great series and will swallow up entire months of your life with his beautifully detailed books.

****Was a little tough to get into in the beginning  but got a lot better starting with part 2. The X-ray feature on kindle really helped me with all the names and terms that get thrown at you in this book.

****I am glad I read the reviews first.  This book was a difficult read in the beginning.  There was just so much going on all at once, but it settled down in the middle and everything tied together nicely.

****Starts off slow, but finishes with a bang.

****I read this at the recomendation of my father (long time sci-fi/fantasy reader)...  Memorable characters & a very deep imersive realm...  Love it enough to continue reading the books that follow.

****Great start,  can't wait to read the next. Got lost at the start but slowly started making sense. Very epic scale.

****Difficult to get into but worth it. A rewarding read for a patient reader. Looking forward to the other nine!

****As an avid reader I do believe that this happens to be an incredible start to a deep story.

Be patient. Finish it up. Enjoy the ride.

****It's a complex book that delivers on point. Definitely not a light read, but a fulfilling one.  If you're looking for a quick easy relaxing adventure story, look elsewhere.

****If you can, stick with this great series. It will reward you eventually. It's even better the second time through.

****Steven Erikson made me realize how tired I am of the protagonist build up in so many other books.
This is refreshing and incredibly gripping at the same time.

Wow

****Amazing original story.

****The best fantasy series ever!! I suggest buying the kindle version because of the constant need to refer to a dictionary and the malazan wiki( atleast in the beggining stages)..

****This is my second time reading the Malazan Series and by far this is my favorite part of the series, and the second time reading the series is better than the first.

****Started slowly, but, once you get past the background stuff it really takes off. A great read, looking forward to the next book!

****I wasn't sure about this book when I first got it, but once I started reading I didn't want to stop.

****little bit difficult starting out, but very well written and amazing story!!

****(I'm going to write one blurb and paste it for each of these books that I have purchased through amazon)
I purchased the entire 10 book set in paperback after reading them all on kindle, and as many audio books as I could find to buy.
I also have 3 or 4 of the side novels in kindle/audio format also.
This story has pushed aside the Shanarra saga to become my favorite.
They remind me of the feeling of the first few Shannara novels, lord of the rings, Game of Thrones.
They are vast adventures spanning time and worlds with great characters and stories.
The writing is very good I think (as someone who has read hundreds of fantasy novels and thousands of other books)
Do note that these are for adults. Some of the books are pretty heavy with graphic violence and rape as well as sex and adult language. I'd suggest reading each book before deciding if they are appropriate for you teenager/young adult.
All of it feels correct for the story but I'd thought I should mention it.

****this is the first book in the series and I enjoyed it.  The number of characters introduced is large, but once you get past that the book is great.

****Not sure what to write. As i bought this book for a relative who is incarcerated. They like the story, and said it arrived within two weeks.

****Love the uniqueness of the world, the magic structures, and the characters. It isn't clear who the good guys and bad guys are, which I love.

****A well structured unique tale. You're dropped into an ongoing story and by the second book you don't even realize it.

****Couldn't put this book down.  I love Erikson's writing style.  His characters have so much depth they come alive off the page.

****Utterly re-readable feast of characters and intrigue in a world of mystery and chaos,a must for fans of fantasy or otherwise.

****Part of the fun of this series is piecing together the history and how the whole world works together as you read the book.

****I would give it tem stars if  I could

****I started at book seven after reading it I had to start at beginning, this is an awesome start to series I will finish

****Great book. Immersive background and characters.
All the components of a classic fantasy novel

****The world, characters, and plot of this series is amazing. The books only get better after Gardens of the Moon.

****A very intriguing and well written fantasy novel.

****I liked it all. The characters, the magic, the World. It was all Well worth reading. I can only suggest to read it.

****It is a difficult book to start on but worth all the effort. A cult series in all rights and I am part of it

****I anticipate reading all of the series now.  I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next due to this book.

****Enjoyed reading this book very much and I'm going to continue reading the series until I have read them all.

****I was hooked half way through the foreword. This story is a worthy competitor to Sanderson's shardverse.

****Hard to get into but once you're there, oh man.

****Crazy convoluted and interconnected plots and demigods duking it out, what's not to love!

****Fantastic Read from start to finish, can't wait to start the next one in the series!

****Gardens of the Moon is one of my favorite books. The number and scoop of its character is amazing as is the plot. After reading most of the series its very apparent that Erikson knows his work very well. The system of magic contained in Gardens of the Moon is so very much different than in most. Most people that i have talked to say that the first read was rather hard to get though, but i disagree from the opening to its end i found it compelling and enjoyable. The series is pretty long but i haven't found any repetitiveness as of book 7 and i doubt that i will. Thank you Steven Erikson for this very enjoyable work of Deliciousness!

****This book has quickly become one of my all time favorites.

It is quite complex, even to an avid fantasy reader such as myself; but it is really engaging, its setting is unique and alive, and the plot a tapestry of diverse, interesting characters flowing through many sided conflicts.

It is not the most coherent of stories, but doesn't want to be. There are many theatrical or even operatic plot turns that don't make much sense but manage to make the book richer.

I don't think this book can be accurately described in a short review; this book matches Frank Herbert's &#34;Dune&#34; complexity. So I'll just say go and read it.

****Brilliant book! I am highly looking forward to reading the other 9 books in the series. Fantasy is my favorite genre and I love long series because it allows more time to fall in love with the characters. I am a fan of LOTR and Wheel of Time, and have also read The Sword of Truth series, Sword of Shannara, Mistborn, Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy. I was researching which series to start next, and Malazan Book of the Fallen kept coming up. I will say the review are accurate. Steven Erikson does not do info-dumps, so you have to hang in there through the first part of the book because you won't know what's going on. By the end of the book you have come to love the many characters, and stand in awe of how he skillfully weaves numerous threads together. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book, Deadhouse Gates!

****Layers of thought provoking complexity.

****As Bantam, for some inexplicable reason, persists in delaying publication  of Steven Erikson's books in the States, I wanted to announce for those of  you listening---and for those of you who are unfamiliar with the author but  should be---that the sequel to &quot;Gardens of the Moon has been released  in Britain, and is available through amazon.co.uk.  And yes, in many ways  it is even better than the original.
  If you prefer  fantasy that draws upon the familiar, the tried and true as well as tired  conventions, a storyline that is easily  recognized and  with which you are already well acquainted, with a main character whose  adventures you can readily follow and a  plot that is  simple and linear, this is not the book for you. Shifting between a rich  and varied cast of characters, with events taking  place  at a pace that at times leaves the reader breathless, this vivid and  multifaceted tale contains enough material to fill another  author's ten books. And, despite all the twists and turns confronting  the narrative, rarely does the story ever lag or falter, instead  hurtling on through a world so richly imagined and textured that  any other writer must look on in wonder and envy---I know I  certainly do.
  Stephen Donaldson has hailed the  author's imagination as being &quot;vast in scope&quot; and &quot;almost  frighteningly fecund.&quot; I could not  agree more.  This is a work that demands the reader's attention: so much is taking place  that if you blink you may miss it. Though  at times the  author's prolific weaving of plot threads and imaginative furies can almost  overreach themselves, never once is the  reader left  long dangling, instead swept back into the maelstrom of events and worlds  that not so much unfold as rush to be  revealed,  anticipation racing over every page. Even in rare moments, when the  narrative's aims seem unclear, the vivid writing  holds  one spellbound.
  Quite an accomplishment, and not for  the faint of heart. Without a doubt, one of the best books of the year.  There's a new voice in  fantasy, one as ringing and  exuberant and clear as a legion's clarion call, and it belongs to Steven  Erikson.

****It's Malazan of course its great!

****Great start to an epic story.

****While initially I felt that the world was too huge and I'd never get a grasp of all of what was going on, about 1/4th of the way through I realized I was invested and had everything I needed to enjoy the plot and characters, and the extra stuff I didn't know made the world simply feel more alive. I enjoyed the complexity of the characters, the clear thought poured into creating this world, and the twists and turns of the plot.

****Give it time. Like many reviews point out, you will be thrown head first into a pile of new names, magics, and places at the beginning (often without much background initially). However, if you make it past the start it will all begin to come together and you will be rewarded with an excellent fantasy book.

****If you're a fan of fantasy and you're looking for something new, then you should definitely consider this book. Though there is a lot of challenge in piecing together the underlying histories and characters, I never once questioned the authors ability to guide me along.

For any writers out there, it may also be worth your time to experience the adept way Erikson handles third person omniscient as he jumps into the minds of many characters in any given passage. I felt impressed at how seamless the transitions were as he entered the headspace of each player.

****Gave as gift.

****This book opened my eyes, fantasy can be so much more than heroes and villains. Everything is grey and even the most likable characters have their darker sides.

Be warned though, this book is certainly requires some diving into. There are many different characters with each their own motives and background. A book by Steven Eriksson  by Steven Erikson is not an easy read, but it is certainly is a rewarding one!

****I started this series and became addicted, waiting impatiently for each new release. I'm on my second pass. (Had to buy the Kindle version because I loaned my hardback out--never again.) I recommended the series to my brother-in-law, who is also hooked.

The first book is a little slow to get started, but then this is an epic journey. There's not a whole lot of deep characterization, though there's a character in the book for everyone to fall in love with, if not two or three or a squad.

If you love action and the broad sweep of history and time and things that make you think deep thoughts, then this might be the series for you.

****The depth of history and culture that Erickson creates, captures and puts on paper is breathtaking, you are immersed in a world that doesn't have the time to explain everything to you as a reader, the only choice you have is to hold on and go with it, hoping that by the end of the ride you where a part of it! An if like me you loved every second, even the moments of confusion!

Remember this is the start of your Malayan journey, if you can stick with it, you will be hooked for life, and every re read will she's more light on the world and you will learn more and more! It is a truly brilliant book series!

****The scope of this book is unbelieveble. If you enjoy Tolkien or fantasy books then this is something for you.

But beware this is not a book for children and you have to put in a lot of effort in order too really understand it. But if you do, then this book and the 9 others in the serie has the potentiel to become the best read ever :)

****I have been reading Fantasy for over 2 decades now, and I did not think that anything could match the work of George R.R. Martin, or Robert Jordan.  Well I was Wrong!  I read "Gardens of the Moon" over 3 days, which says much about the but since I read at a slower pace.  I could not put the book down.  This book put my wife, video games, food, and sleeping in the back seat while it held me in sublime raputre.  I feel horrible for neglecting my wife and my health but I do not have any regrets!  The first book is just as good as before mentioned authors if not better in many ways.

I would, and have recommended this book to everyone I know, and all who like to read fiction.  I am allways worried when I buy a book for the first time, fearing that the book will be written in the First Person i.e. "Interview with the Vampire" Twilight" so on and so forth!  I hate books that are written like that.  I was pleasently suprised to find out that Steven Erikson can write Narritive Fiction really well.  The Story has great pacing and many climaxes.  I logged onto Amazon as soon as I finished "Gardens of the Moon" and oredered the remaining 8 books in the series that are currently out!

****And worth it. Everything you have heard, well yeah, all of that is true. It's like snorting coke through a straw, except the coke is a jigsaw puzzle and the straw is on fire.

****Erikson drops you right into the middle of the action in this fast-paced first volume of The Malazan Book of the Fallen, introducing a number of important characters and themes that recur throughout the later books in the series. Erikson is a master of characterization and the depth and breadth of the world that he has created almost staggers belief. I never thought I would find a series of books that I would love as much as The Lord of the Rings but this is it!

****Great beginning to a good series. Starts slow but pay attention. I'm on book three now and I'm still loving it.

****Steven Erikson is known for not holding your hand. There's no characters asking to explain aspects to the world that they would already know. No long exposition on how the world or magic system works. Thus the names, vernacular, and historical references completely go over ones head. But the ultimate payoff is worth it. These books are meant to be re-read. A great start to the series, and the books only get stronger from here.

****First, let me say, this book and series is a complex piece of literature. The world which Erikson places the reader in is quite developed and has an extensive history which is important (as it is often referenced). There are often multiple story lines to follow as well as a dozen or so characters, too. So if you are looking for an easy read requiring little attention, you might pass on this book.

However, if you are interested in an engaging story with often a series of stories slowly intertwining into an all encompassing convergence then you are looking at the right book. This series has many stories to tell, and sometimes from multiple perspectives and often not along the same timeline. At one point you will read about an event and then a few pages later, chapter later, even a book later, the same story will be told from a different perspective. This is something I love about the books, they make you think. The story is rarely laid out for you to see. Erikson gives you the puzzle pieces but you have to assemble the story; at least to fully understand it.

The characters are shockingly real and are not at all a typical hero-character; no one is impervious to Erikson. They have a depth to them that makes you feel like there are many things you'll never know about them despite being privy to private lives or secret thoughts.

I have religiously read this series more than once and each time have found parts of the story that I didn't notice before; often because the relevant event they pertained to wasn't explained at the time or hadn't even occurred. That is another fascinating trait of Erikson's writing is that he will foreshadow to a significant event with perhaps only a passing statement or silent thought.

I highly recommend this book as well as the other 8 that are out to all who want to follow a rigorous plot and mysterious characters.

Power draws Power.

****I found about this book and series from the NPR top 100 books for science fiction and fantasy.  The book started off a bit slow, but picked up fairly quick and was totally hooked at the end.  Very intriguing characters.  Also, I like the fact the series has 10 primary books.  Plenty of stuff to read and won't end too quickly.

****As good as the Black Company and the First Law. Everything that I hoped Game of Thrones would be (but wasn't).

The writing is fantastic - as good as anything contemporary, while the story, characters and world-building is truly fantastic. Highly recommended !

****Amazing fantasy series! Dont let the cover art fool you. Fantastic character development along with an immersing plot. Epic battles, assassins, mages, dragons, "sappers". This series has it all. Never a dull moment

****Amazing series! Erikson is an excellent writer and I couldn't put the books down.

****The story never stalls because it has layers upon layers upon layers.  A very interesting world Erikson created.  The fantasy aspect of it is extreme but realistic in the context of the story.

****A beautiful beginning. His writing spins you into this fanciful world of demons, assassins, gods, and magic. Amazing book! I can't wait to read the next.

****An enormously absorbing work of fantasy.  Be prepared: this drops you straight into the middle of a highly complex world with a deep history, a relatively complicated system of magic, and many, many characters.  You'll feel overwhelmed at the start, but it's worth it to keep reading.  A treat if you like a mixture of action and intrigue set in a giant, fully-formed fantasy world.

****Fantastic world and magic system with a tight plot and deft writing. Worth getting into, no doubt. Diverse characters come together in an unexpected climax that leaves you wanting more.

****This is not your average epic fantasy.  So well written and thought out.  Many characters to keep track of at first but each unique and
well fit into the overall arc of the story.  Kudos to Steven Erikson for this brilliant book.  Onto the second installment now.
I can imagine this being the measuring stick for all future fantasy authors.

****Very good. Starting book in a long epic series.

****Loved this book, but definitely not a casual read. Characters, time and place shifted so frequently that I printed off a character reference sheet when I first started. There's a reference guide at the back of the book, but since I was reading this on my kindle, that feature wasn't as effective as it would have been if it were in print.

****Though the story may be somewhat daunting, anyone brave enough to begin this ten volume epic will not be disappointed. Confusion turns into mystery and mystery to the unveiling of majesty. A tale full of Ascendant beings, gods, and mortals with enough grit to stand up to either. Highly recommended!

****Love it or hate it,  there can be no denying Malazan Book of the Fallen (of which Gardens of the Moon is the first book) is a large work: 10 books coming in at about 700-1000 pages per book, running over 3 million words.

It is also probably the greatest work of fiction ever created.  It is a classic that will be studied, reviewed, reviled, commented upon, and taught for the next 500 years.  Not everyone like to read Shakespeare, but I don't think anybody will deny the genius involved with creating his plays.  So too with Steven Erikson and his Malazan Book of the Fallen.  Not everyone will read Erikson, but the mark he has placed upon the landscape of literature will be felt for years.

Many criticize the series for its length, for its complex plots, and for seemingly endless stream of loose ends and new characters.  Here is one thing you need to keep in mind about this series: it is a metafictional construct designed to engage the reader as an actual participant in the books.  Nothing so obvious as breaking the third wall happens, there are no winking nods or sly asides directly addressed to the reader, but the reader is the true protagonist of the series.

So if you are a fan of large, complex, epic literature with deeply imagined characters and amazing action, pick up Gardens of the Moon and begin a hero's journey of your own through an amazing series.  If you stick with it, you will be rewarded immensly and will come of the experience a different person.

****A truly epic story - Erikson has built an incredibly detailed universe here. Definitely not an easy read, particularly if you want to keep the people, places and mythology straight, but certainly worth it. That said - best read as the start of the overall series rather than a stand-alone novel.

****Book quality was exactly as was written in description. For someone such as myself that only buys hardcover books this was a steal. I was able to save a lot of money buying used with like new quality.

****A great read.  I am now on  the sixth booki.  That should tell you all you need to know.  The best writer of  bloody battle scenes involving the living, the undead,  and the deamon beasts of nightmares.  Enjoy.

****This book drops you in the middle of the action. As you attempt to understand the history and politics, you start to feel for the characters. I felt an attachment to characters from all sides of the conflict. Nothing is black or white but different shades of silver...

****I love Erikson's work.  He is a retired Archaeologist and really knows how to add depth to a culture like no other author.  This gives the characters meaningful back stories and motivations that really hit home with the reader.  His understanding of military culture is fantastic.

****Great product.

****And I mean that literally -- such a fantastic series with amazingly detailed and in-depth writing that'll bring you right into the world and mind of Erikson.

****Great fantasy book. Drama, magic, dragons, and gods. Reminded me of books like the series a song of ice and fire.

****This book is for anyone who likes fantasy. It was epic. Plenty of plots and twists to keep you entertained. It does plunge you right into a complete world without a lot of context which proves to be confusing at first, but stick it out. You will be pleased!

****If you're a fan of Game of Thrones, Dune, The Black Company, or Patrick Rothfuss, you will love Steven Erikson's Malazan books.  An intricate mastery of world building with history spanning hundreds of thousands of years.  A delight to read.

****This series always has and always will be a favorite of mine, a truly engrossing tale that I can never put down

****Gosh, like the title says.  It's a difficult to start for some people, but i absolutely adored how he began this work.  For those who have a hard time starting: It's so freakin worth it.

****My husband is a nerd and loves these books. He can't put them down! They're so good I forget I'm married!

****I read quite a bit, almost exclusively within the High Fantasy genre, so I can say with some certainty that this is one of the best series out there. The only series I would even consider comparing to The Wheel of Time.

****This one was a ride. I really, really liked this book, and I think it was a hell of a start to a 10-book epic. And epic is most definitely the right word for it because man, there are a lot of moving pieces here. Erikson drops you onto the continent of Genabackis in the middle of an Imperial military campaign, and you essentially have to try to keep up. Many readers talk about how confusing this book is, and that it's something you just have to get through, but my advice is to not let that dissuade you. I think rather than expecting confusion, you should expect resolution and understanding to eventually come. Just trust Steven on this one, because although I now have only an inkling of the story, I trust that he knows what he's doing.

Reading this book gave me a feeling of immersion and excitement that I haven't felt since I first read Dune (my favorite book) when I was around 13 years old. When I picked up Dune I was shocked to see a glossary at the back. A work of fiction so vast that it needs its own glossary? It was fantastic. I couldn't get enough of it; learning these new words and new places, experiencing this whole new world alongside the characters. Those same feelings came back to me as I read Gardens of the Moon, holding my fingers in the front and back of the book, flipping to and from maps and glossaries and character lists learning all that I could. I think I'm in for the long haul on this one.

****Loved it , one of the best in the genre along side The Black Company.  I look forward to the next books

****Not your typical fantasy book! A good read!

****This series is worth your time, your money, possibly your first born child. Those of you who sit and wait for Martin to finish, this one is finished as of March 1st, 2011. Amazing series. I'm not going to ramble and explain why, just trust me. You'll thank me.

****For hardened fantasy readers, don't let the reviews about confusion worry you in the least. The story is easy to follow and prompts a good amount of speculation necessary for a good book to hook you in.

****This is a very dense book, and a bit of a challenge to get into. It definitely expects you to hit the ground running. However, you will find yourself unable to put it down, and aching for the next instalment when you're done.

****Probably the most unorthodox piece of fantasy I've read, said in a most positive manner. Philosophical without getting metaphysical and yet still grounded in realpolitik and complex strategic maneuvering.

****Once you get about halfway through the book really takes off and keeps getting better.

****This is my first attempt to read an Erickson, honestly i had never even heard of the guy.  after reading the Gardens of the Moon, i definately know who Steven Erikson is now!! this book is really well written, (although the first 150 pages are a little confusing) but if you keep going, everything makes sense.  After about 300 pages of Gardens of the Moon, and reading the reviews on the other books, i went out and purchased the other remaining 8 available books, and will get the 10th when it comes out.

****Its a great story, I like Joe Abercrombie and GRR, and I wanted something similar. Not quite the same, but Overall wonderful read and will read the next in the series.

****Before reading this book I heard a lot of people saying how it was hard to understand until you get to other books in the series. After reading the book, I disagree.

****The book has a vibrant world with hundreds of characters. Great read. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the rest of the series.

****Take the time to really enjoy the story weaving. This book reads like an og anime. Very confusing at times but well worth it

****The Malazan Book of the Fallen series (all 10) is possibly the only TRUE epic fantasy series ever written. The shear scope of characters, magic systems, history and the world that Erikson (and Esslemont) built is staggering!
After reading series like The Wheel of Time, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and Game of Thrones I thought I had a firm grasp on the meaning of Epic Fantasy....but I was wrong!
I have never felt the need to re-read a series of books but Malazan is so awesome that I've had to go back! I am up to book 4 again and almost enjoying it more than the first read through!
There is a lot to take in, with events occurring on several contents and story following 10+ characters each book, and hints are made to events that don't become apparent until books later.
Don't start the series expecting to be spoon fed character backgrounds, etc, you are thrown right into the fray from the beginning and I loved every (somewhat confusing) minute of it!

****The beginning of the best series ever. Intricate, humorous, and generally bad ass. You never know what will happen next.

****From start to finish I was glued to this book, reading non-stop. I'm looking forward to wants in store for the series.

****I can't believe I'd only recently ever heard of this series.  I will admit that Steve throws a lot of characters at you early in the book but by not too long into the book I couldn't put it down.  My first reaction after finishing the book is to immediately start the second.  I've only had that reaction to a few series before (I.e. A song of Ice and Fire and the Mistborn Trilogy).  Can't wait to get started on the next book!

****Not easy to get in to but an amazing story with great characters if you manage to put the effort in.

****Great book, good complexity. A little slow at parts but it allows for the story to be further developed.

****A bit corny and over the top at points, but a very enjoyable read if you are into fantasy.

****Enjoyable Read! Always fun reading about new characters and new worlds!

****Fantastic book starting the most engaging and interesting series ever written.

****A favourite book series of mine. Just get through the first half and it's just lovely.

****Can't find anything to match this entire series,So I Started all over again.

****Erikson can be tough to read at times but is well worth it in the end.

****I absolutely love this series, I am totally absorbed in a different world when i read these books.
A word of warning though,  these books are not for the feint hearted, Steven Erikson will not hold your hand for a stroll through a foreign land. He will dump you right in the maelstrom, literally from page one, then it's sink or swim. i recommend swimming because once you find your feet your are in for an incredible experience supported by incredible characters.

****A tough start, but an impressive read altogether! A must read for fantasy fans!

****Erikson has no equal in the epic Fantasy genre.  'Nuff said.

****Engrossing read so far!

****Wow great book,couldnt stop reading it from day 1

****Good so far, it's a very complex book with lots going on.

****Great read looking forward to the next 9. Not sure why allot of people find it hard to follow.

****Descriptive world building and a captivating narrative.

****I read a lot of fanticy series and this is one of the best. Had my interest from the start.

****I read each book as they came out over many years. I'm starting the series all over again and I can really appreciate the complexity of the tale. Great book

****This series is very complicated, and quite confusing at first.  If you don't have the patience to try and figure things out on your own from contextual clues over the course of several books, then this is not the series for you.  Nothing is spoon-fed.  BUT, if you do power through it, the payoff is a fantastically complex set of plots, characters and themes.

Religious conflicts?  It's got it.
Racial tensions?  It's got it.
Economic savvy?  It's got it.
Deep ideas?  It's got it.

This series is one giant allegory for real life.  Keeping with that idea: we aren't spoon-fed how we handle life, nor should we be spoon-fed how to understand this series.  We figure that out on our own.

If that hasn't sold you, I'll try one last thing:  Only Steven Erikson can turn a murdering rapist into a beloved character by the end of the series.

****Each time I read it, more of the subtle brilliance emerges.  Get ready for a fantastic ride.  Honestly the best novel I've ever had the pleasure to read, and it only gets better with the subsequent books.

****I started to read this one years ago and couldn't really get into it. It's not the most accessible reading. Then I picked it up recently, decided to put in the effort to really pay attention and was rewarded.

Some writers tend to micro-manage a reader's impression of a character, a world or the mood of the story. Erikson has a talent for leaving room to interpret these characters, this world and the mood of this story, through one's own moral compass. The most obvious way he accomplishes this is through telling the story via multiple perspectives. There is not much in the way of black and white or decidedly good and evil here. When you think there is a clear moral stance it vanishes before your preconceived notions and those morals change or become more complex when a character's motivations are revealed. I love that. It is more true to human nature than the illusion of clearly defined good and bad.

I do love his world building skill. And the way he connects a character's motivations based on that character's place and development within this complex world.

This novel starts off with a good deal of exposition, weaving a lot of backstory in with the more immediate narratives, especially at the beginning. But it does build up into a fairly intense ending. While further books in the story do get more intense, I found this an excellent introduction to this challenging and brutal world.

One of my favorite things is the way he writes dialogue. The reader is forced to read between the lines and infer. What is unspoken, is often what speaks and tells the story. I find that the mood of this story and the world is often shown or inferred by the spareness in dialogue at times. If one isn't paying attention to the exposition, one may not catch something that is vaguely hinted at in the dialogue and it might be something fairly important to understanding the story. As a reader I love that challenge. And the reward is a much more engrossing story.

****Full disclosure, I bought this book three years ago, read forty pages and threw it on the floor. I didn't know what the hell was going on. I recently wanted an epic series in the fantasy genre and kept reading reviews on this book. I changed my reading style a little for this book. Instead of needing a linear plot and everything to make sense right now, I just started reading and let the book tell the story in it's own time. I have to say that this book is an amazing journey into a world that is both complex and rewarding. You will be thrown into conversations, locations and battles without knowing the players in the beginning, but you will begin to piece things together and crave for more. Once you start to understand Erikson's writing style, you will appreciate that unique style. The characters are many, plots vast, but I really enjoyed all of it. The book has a tension that exists the entire way and no character is safe.  I'm glad I picked up this book again and now I understand why it has such a following, you will not find a more enjoyable and thought provoking fantasy read. I look forward to book two

****At first, I was not sure about this book. There is a lot going on, and you have to pay attention. I can be a lazy reader, and I seriously doubted that the read would be worth the effort. But if you're looking for something truly epic, original, and engaging, Gardens of the Moon is for you. This book gives the reader a true feeling of grand scale that shines through the complexity of the intertwining stories. Much of the story is not revealed until the end, and there is much that is not revealed within the scope of the book itself, but the end of the book is one of the grandest payoffs I've had with a novel. This book has one of the most satisfying denouements I can think of, and the price is paid in patience during the earlier reading.  I've read books that have pages upon pages of action without story or story without action, but Erikson does a fantastic job of bringing the two together in a finale that the pulled me along with him.  Stepping my previous comments back a bit, if you go back and reread the beginning, you'll find that Erikson does reveal quite a bit. It's simply the case that one cannot appreciate it until one has read the full story. The writing is deep.  One piece of advice: because so many of the tropes are original, and therefore unfamiliar, if you're lazy like me it's not necessarily a bad idea to visit the Malazan Book of the Fallen wiki to double check details. If you are careful, you can avoid spoilers, and it will help you keep track of the many new concepts, characters, etc.

****It took me a year off and on to get through this book.  It's written in such a complex world without explanation that it is tedious and more like studying than casual reading.  Too many characters, too many plot lines...I would read then grow tired of having to put so much effort in.  A year later I picked it up again and reread it.  The second time through it was far less complex and less confusing than I had originally found it.  So why 5 stars?  This book is an investment.  It's an investment of effort and time that opens up a series of books that are rich, complex, but increasingly easier to get through.  Stories and plot lines that are nearly unparalleled except in the very finest of the genre.  Books that are as gritty and raw as any of the so called graphic fantasy books.  Plot lines as well thought out as any in high fantasy.  Characters that are real and relatable.  Comparisons between Black Company and this series are obvious, but this world is far richer and well thought out.  The only fault I can say, is that the amazing amount of on world building was somewhat lost on character building (unlike the Black Company).  Altogether, think of this book as an investment to get lost into a wonderful series of books.  Although this book lacks a lot of the violence and grittiness of later books, it does a nice job of revealing a world with no distinct good or evil, just hope and anguish.

****I know this book has been reviewed many time, so take this time as you will.  This is the second time I've read Gardens of the Moon, and I recommend a second reading whole heartedly.  This is a complex book, full of characters in flux, world building, clash of cultures, and enough soul searching to satisfy a room full of monks.  There is magic here too, with its own rules and practices, and a fresh look at how magic might work.  You are thrown into the world with no life line, you have to get your own bearings.  It's worth it to just keep reading, you will meet so many memorable characters, soldier, mage, beauty, politician, thief, a variety of races, gods, demons, dragons, tyrants.  I have never read anything quite like it for introducing so many original ideas that made me look at a lot of long held beliefs about war and the value of life.  It's not a book for the casual reader, but it rewards the adventurous reader handsomely.  Go for it!

****I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend and count it among the most enjoyable fiction I've read this year.

The author sets you down right in the middle of his world without preamble or very much explanation and keeps going from there.

This will be a frustrating and confusing book if you don't enjoy having the world slowly revealed to you over the course of the novel, with a lot of questions remaining once you get to the last page.

I heartily enjoyed the struggle at the beginning of the book to understand everything as it felt like it challenged me as a reader and rewarded my investment later.

Erikson's world reflects many negative aspects of morality and depicts graphic violence and implied sexual content and themes (Though no explicit sex) He also has characters that express a range of realist to pessimistic outlooks on life, bordering on the futility of it.

If none of these things are undesirable or in fact enjoyed by the potential reader, then this book is the introduction into a detailed and expansive universe that is truly epic in scope and creativity.

****I've both read this book many years ago and listened to the audiobook in the past week. Wonderfully written and compelling Gardens of the Moon comes alive in the mind.

****Erikson dropped me into a world with a high learning curve. But I am so glad I stuck through. Something about the characters and the writing itself pulled me in and refused to let go. Until by the end I was incredibly invested and putting the book to the side after finishing with a whispered &#34;wow.&#34; Definitely worth it. I will be buying the rest of the series for sure.

****This book and this series are a Masterpiece of the finest epic fantasy. I am on my second read of the first three books. I found myself a bit lost the first time and read one of the reviewers who recommended reading the first book at least twice. I'm so glad I did. I can't explain why I missed so much the first go around - perhaps I wasn't ready for this unique story telling. Most fantasy is based on good and evil, but Erickson raises the bar and treats us all to a work that lives and dies in shades of grey. I appreciate the dogged realism in his majestic world of sorceresses, gods and politicians. It is an intricately weaved and brilliant work. Erikson has the depth and scope of classical authors and his command of the English language is an unexpected joy and I find myself bathing in such luscious perfection. Dark, original, truly &#34;epic&#34; fantasy. Best I have ever read. Margaret Weiss (Dragon Lance) is my long time favorite fantasy author and, now, Erikson is my second.

****An incredible fantasy novel, like nothing ive ever read before and I've read them all. Gardens of The moon is easily my new favorite book. It is a must read for any fan of fantasy.

****&#34;Now these ashes have grown cold, we open the old book.
These oil-stained pages recount the tales of the Fallen,
a frayed empire, words without warmth. The hearth
has ebbed, its gleam and life's sparks are but memories
against dimming eyes - what cast my mind, what hue my
thoughts as I open the Book of the Fallen
and breathe deep the scent of history?
Listen, then, to these words carried on that breath.
These tales are the tales of us all, again yet again.
We are history relived and that is all, without end that is all.&#34;

So opens Gardens of the Moon, book one of the now famed Malazan Book of the Fallen series. I saw a thread on reddit about fantasy series that are unafraid to harm their characters in the spirit of, 'A Song of Ice and Fire' (ASOIAF) and one name seemed to appear more then any other, Malazan. The world of Malazan, like that of most epic fantasy, is strongly reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons settings. The boundary between god and men is ever changing, men become gods and men slay gods. There are priests who draw powers from their gods and there are mages who draw powers from so called warrens. There are also far more people who are without a doubt average. The level of technology is firmly dark to middle ages.

As a devourer of epic fantasy I feel like I have to begin by making some comparisons to give you an idea of where exactly Malazan lies. It adventure is broader reaching then Lord of the Rings, it has a far broader story to tell. Though the books are each longer than a book in ASOIAF they feel more focused in a way then GRRM's writing. Each chapter is intelligently written and holds within it some key to the puzzle. The characters also seem more focused. Unlike ASOIAF, Gardens of the Moon begins somewhat in media res and it might take you a bit to get your bearings, and the book seems to continually reveal more of the world within which it's set making every new chapter somewhat an exploration which really helps the pacing of the book. For example each new 'book' (a subsection within the book itself) begins with an almost poetic narrative, such as the one I posted above from the prologue. On top of this, each chapter begins with a snipping from a historical text that in some way provides more background about the chapter, or foreshadows a character development. The characters also hold my interest more than the flat characters of Wheel of Time ever could. I am already going on quite long but suffice it to say this is the best fantasy thought I have ever had the pleasure to read, and I am already half way through book two. If you are unsure of whether or not this is for you, try the free sample from amazon and then make your purchase.

****I read the reviews before reading and was concerned about a lot of people complaining about the sheer number of characters on another review site and how it was extremely confusing. Now that Im done I have to say that this book was actually very good. I have a lot of trouble keeping track of characters in books especially if they are very weird names. But maybe because I was forewarned about the large number of characters, I read the book more slowly than usual and didnt have any trouble whatsoever keeping track of the characters, places etc.

If I recall, George RR Martin's books also have a ton of characters, places etc and I remember feeling a bit more confused reading the first book of that series.

As I was reading the book I kept thinking of the black company books which I loved and then I read some reviews here on amazon which mentioned the black company and I completely agree this book has a similar feel.

Many have said this first book was the worst - I thought it was pretty good so Im excited about the next ones. I definitely think this book is a buy.

****Drawn in by a unique writing g style offering a godlike perspective of the lives of his wonderful characters being intertwined into one epic story. A window to another universe, exploring life's themes in a brilliant hue, that you can't help looking through.

****I have read the Malazan series twice through now, and have not lost interest either time.  If you have the patience to allow plot lines to develop, and the characters also, you will be taken on an amazing journey across years and continents of the Malazan world.  You will be party to rich landscapes, amazing characters, and a wonderful story nicely balanced with humor.

In edition to:  I have now read this through a 3rd time.  This is an amazingly complex series of books.  It can be seen as difficult to get into, as Erickson just drops you off in an unfamiliar world, with unfamiliar characters, and unfamiliar settings.  But, this is one of the deepest, and richest creations I have EVER read.  For me that's saying something.  I have a personal library I have built over the last25+ years.  I peruse bookstores and the internet, always buying, never selling or trading.  I own several thousand books, and have read almost all of them.  This series is very much one of my favorites of all time.  The only detractor, is that when you get to the end, it will be very very hard to pick up another book and continue to read.

****I tried to get into this series when I was younger and failed. 7 years later a friend recommended
it to me and I reluctantly read Gardens of the Moon, and then promptly raced through the entire series.

I can fully understand the mixed reviews this book has been getting and the things that
I enjoy about it are probably what put me off it initially. So I'll just give a run through of
why I enjoyed it.

1.) Never knowing what the hell is going on. So many new characters , nations and new ideas are
  introduced, a lot of history is alluded to or told in snatches and only very rarely is anything
  ever explained. I've come to prefer this to the author holding my hand or quickly running through the
  last N books of the series in the first 20 pages of their new novel.

2) Tragedy. Don't get too attached to character X because you'll probably only see them briefly for a few books
  if you're lucky or they'll be killed off/maimed any second now. There are a few exceptions and while there is a
  theme of tragedy running through these books there are also odd and almost random moments of laugh out loud hilarity.

3) Who are the good guys? Are the bad guys really the bad guys? A cast of almost entirely gray characters and the
  avoidance of quite a few overdone tropes makes it among the more enjoyable fantasy series I have read.

Good read, nice change of pace and subversion of tropes. Not for everyone.

****I was introduced to the Malazan Empire when reading the book "Re-reading A GAME OF THRONES: An Unauthorized Response to George R. R. Martin's Fantasy Classic by Remy J. Verhoeve (Apr 17, 2011)" available at Amazon.
The author Remy (a.k.a. Slynt) mentioned that a few books had the same scope as ASOFAI books, and the Malazan saga was one of them.  So I had to check it out, because after reading all the books from A Song of Fire and Ice, I wanted more!

If you got confused with all the houses in Westeros, prepare to put on your thinking cap to read Gardens of the Moon.  I think I never resorted so much to the search function of my Kindle, which is kind of a must have to read these books, so much you will be going back and forth to make all the connections about what's happening.  And when you realize you caught some of the (many) connections within the book, it's a great moment.

But it all fits together, even in the very first book where we get plunged right into action.  I have seen some people complain that the first book is hard to follow because of the little exposition on the background information about the peoples, gods, warrens in the book; but my opinion is that what you need to understand (and greatly enjoy) the book is there.  And in the next books things get much clearer anyway, so there is a very high re-read value in this first book.

But it is not an easy read at all.
Still, highly recommended!  You will not regret it!

****I think Steven Erikson has done a great thing writing the books the way he has. I am on his second book in the series now, and they are extremely difficult to START. He throws you into a river and expects you to swim like a fish, which I think is very unrealistic for most casual readers. Once you get past the fast start, his books are extremely difficult to put down. He has done something I think is very cool by the way he engineered magic in his world. There are the different types but how people access their magic is very cool. Also, he puts a character into this book which has almost unlimited power, but he writes him very well. It's an easy trap for authors to just make their characters all powerful with no rules, and much harder to limit their powers, but he pulls it off excellently in this novel. I couldn't be happier to be reading the 2nd book in the series since I got past the hard start again! You will feel so good putting down his books, the only problem will be wanting to read the rest of the series immediately!

****Great read. Mr Erickson is very imaginative and creative.

****Great dark fantasy. We'll written, deeply layered story that unfortunately starts in the middle if the overall story arc (at least it seems so far as I have not finished the series yet). I have re-read this several times to make sure I didn't miss anything (I did). Well worth the effort though. Love the characters. Love this book. If you liked elric of melnibone or anything similar then read this book, it's dope.

****I have been hearing for several years how good this series is.  I was not disappointed.  It has excellent writing, engaging characters and a well developed world.  I did find myself wondering about certain things in the history but most were explained.  Patience is your friend.

This book reminded me of several other series.  There were hints of The Black Company, Lord of the Rings and several others.  If you enjoyed those you will probably enjoy this book.  I intend to read the entire series.

****I downloaded this book from the kindle store probably about 2 years ago.  A lot of people had said good things about it so I gave it a try... and quickly got frustrated and bored.  Luckily, I had the second to last Wheel of Time book left to read so I read that.  After I finished Towers of Midnight, I thought I'd give Gardens of the Moon another go, but the characters didn't seem significant, and I didn't care when they were inevitably dispatched.  So I set this one down and read through a few more fantasy series, took a hiatus from reading here and there, and eventually gave Gardens of the Moon a final go.

Well, somewhere between half and two-thirds of the way through the book, things started to make sense, the writing smoothed itself out, and I found I actually cared.  When I finished it, even with the early difficulty getting into the story, I felt what I had read was as good as the great books I had read in the interim, including The Way of Kings, The Name of the Wind, and The Night Angel trilogy.

I would repeat the recommendation of another reviewer: don't worry if you don't get it at first, just keep going and things will start to make more sense.

****Steven Erikson is amazing. The Malazan books are hands down the best. I am finishing gardens of the moon again and I'm super impressed. It definitely gets better once you're more familiar with the world where it all takes place. If you haven't read anything by Erikson then you need to get busy!

****Erikson is doing something extraordinary with this series! Gardens of the Moon represents to me one of the most definitive, armor clad 'foot in the door' novels this genre has ever offered. This novel interweaves story lines going back hundreds of thousands of years, hints at layers and depth which can leave you totally stunned while at the same time delivering an unparalled stand alone story. Don't worry, throughout the series one does begin to develop a more panoptic view of this writhing, tangled epic. I am on Toll the Hounds now and have developed a true respect for this author (as I'm sure you will too).

****Enjoyed it. It was a more difficult read than what I had been reading....writing style more complex. I should have read the Dramatis Personae first but I am a man and I don't ask for directions either. After completing it I went back to a series I had been reading earlier and realized the big difference in style...finished it in two sittings. So I decided to buy the next book in the Malazan series.

****Good AF.

****I loved every second of this book. The author has created a world of plots and intrigue that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't wait to read the rest of this series. Five stars all the way.

****Couldn't put it down

****Awesome-awesome

****Excellent book....

****Thanks.

****This is a great book, my friends and myself plan on reading all of this series.

****This is my second time reading Gardens of the Moon as it was even better than the first. Erickson paints a fantastic picture and sucks you into it, love this series and would recommend it to any high fantasy fan.

****A true epic, both in world scale and in plot. Expertly woven story and worldbuilding without any obvious handholding. Memorable characters that stay deliciously grey morally. Can't wait to read more.

****I was daunted by other review of the book, as many mentioned the overload of information and that the series was tough to get into for some. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cannot wait to read the next book in the series.

****Started in Australia and finished in Florida. Started slow but gathered speed. Affinity for the characters grew. The plot had plenty of twists and turns.

****It took me a while to get into this series but I'm far from disappointed. Look forward to what's instore for book 2.
